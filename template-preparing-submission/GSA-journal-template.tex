\section*{Introduction}

Thyroid cancer can develop from the different cells that form the follicles of the thyroid. This gland located at the base of the throat secretes hormones such as T3 and T4 that have metabolic functionalities such as control of heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight \citep{tcga}.

From the four types of thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer) Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid cancer \citep{Agrawal2014a}. It is more prevalent in women than men and its common diagnosis occurs between 25 and 65 years old \citep{risk}.

Driver onco-mutations for this type of cancer appear as alterations of the MAPK signaling pathway and the PI3K-AKT pathway \citep{Kimura2003}. Both are implied in cell proliferation and survival and in human tumorigenesis. The overactivation of the MAPK pathway because of mutations such as the BRAFV600E mutation, leads to the development of PTC from follicular thyroid cells. On the other hand, mutations that activate the PI3K-AKT pathway, such as mutations in RAS, PTEN and PIK3CA, mostly leads to development of Follicular Thyroid Adenoma (FTA) and Follicular Thyroid Cancer (FTC) also in follicular thyroid cells \citep{Xing2013a}.

Research from \citet{tcga} focused on PTC and they found that a part from alterations in BRAF, specifically BRAFV600E, and RAS, there are other driver mutations such the ones in EIF1AX PPM1D and CHEK2 genes that are main alterations for that type of thyroid cancer. They proposed a new classification of PTC subtypes based on their molecular findings. 

The aim of our project deviates from being a replicate of the TCGA project. Our academic purpose has been to study differentially expressed genes from tumor and normal samples but also taking into account whether there could be a gender effect on the tumorgenesis of PTC. To our knowledge, there is no clear reason why thyroid cancer is more prevalent in women than men \citep{intro}. Therefore, it would be interesting to analyze whether there are differentially expressed genes within genders and respect to thyroid cancer. In addition, in case there are significant differences in gene expression which are the potential biological effects of such genes. 


\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Data Availability and Filtering}
In order to shed light on the previous hypothesis we have centered our study in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma with RNA-seq data of The Cancer Genome Atlas \citep{tcga}. Concretely, the datasets used have been the ones preprocessed by \citet{Rahman2015} using the \citet{subread} pipeline. Therefore, we started with a data set of 20115 genes, 572 samples, 549 sample variables.

We have applied different filters to the data. On one hand, from exploration of the data we selected those individuals that had tumor and normal samples (paired data) to reduce variability (118 samples: 59 normal and 59 tumor). In addition, to reduce the size of the subset we also discarded clinical variables under 60 \% of the useful information (we kept 44 variables). Using the information of the clinical variables that were not discarted we selected the most abundant population in the samples which are the "white" and "not hispanic or latino" group, so we decide to perform the analysis on this group of individuals whose type of cancer is the "classical" Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (66 samples: 33 normal and 33 tumor).

On the other hand,  we also filtered for those samples with a depth substantially lower than the rest, specifically below 40 million reads (54 samples: 27 normal and 27 tumor). Moreover, we have considered a cutoff of 1 log CPM unit as minimum value of expression to select genes being expressed across samples. Using this cutoff we have filtered out lowly-expressed genes (we kept 11801 genes). 

The final subset for the analysis end up with 11801 genes, 54 samples (27 normal and 27 tumor) from 27 patients.  

\subsection*{Normalization and Quality Assessment}
All the analysis presented in this study has been done using the R statistical programming language \citep{R}. Data has been managed within \textit{SummarizedExperiment} class object container \citep{SummarizedExperiment} of the Bioconductor open-source and open-development software for R \citep{Gentleman2004}. Before any analysis, we have normalized the data following the edgeR pipeline for normalizing expression data \citep{Robinson2010}.First of all scaling the data into \textit{counts per million reads} (CPM) with cqn package \citep{Hansen2012}. We decided not to use the function \textit{calcNormFactors} which has implemented the \textit{Trimmed Mean of M-values} (TMM) method of the \textit{edgeR} R/Bioconductor package \citep{Robinson2010a} because according to the \textit{cqn} vignette, there is no need to normalize using this type of tools as later we used the offsets computed by \textit{cqn} \citep{Hansen2012} and resulted in a more comparable samples. 
Then we have checked for biases in the data with MA plots (see Supplementary Materials). From the MA plots we discarded tumor and normal samples from  A3PR id patient because we detected relevant expression-level dependent bias so the subset was reduced to 52 samples (26 tumor and 26 normal) from 26 patients.

\subsection*{Batch effects assessment}
A part from normalization, we also have considered possible batch effects. We have used the information of the TCGA barcode included in the sample identification as surrogates for batch effect indicators following the MD Anderson Cancer Center strategy \citep{batch}. We looked at the cross-classification of our outcome of interest (normal vs. tumor) and the candidate indicators of batch effect: samplevial, tss, 
portion and plate (see Supplementary Materials). A part from that, we also have used hierarchical clustering of the samples calculating the distances between each pair of samples with the Spearman correlation and then using the \textit{hclust} function of R. To further investigate whether batch might be a source of variation we perfomed a mutidimensional scaling using the function \textit{plotsMDS} of the Bioconductor/R package \textit{edgeR} \citep{Robinson2010}. After identification of the batch effect (see Supplementary Materials), we have used different strategies to remove it. First, we tried with the function \textit{ComBat} of the Bioconductor/R \textit{sva} package \citep{sva}. We also have used QR descomposition technique implemented in the \textit{limma} Bioconductor/R package \citep{limma} through the function \textit{removeBatchEffect}. Third strategy used has been the SVD method \citep{Alter2000} which was implemented in the Bioconductor/R package \textit{corpcor} \citep{corpcor} with the function \textit{fast.svd}.

\subsection*{Differential expression analysis}
In order to perform the differential expression analysis we used \textit{limma} R/Bioconductor package with a workflow based on what has been previously published \citep{limma}. We build the design matrix and calculated the observational-level weights with function \textit{voom} from \textit{limma}. As we were working with paired data we estimated the correlation in repeated measurements before fitting the linear model. Finally we build and fitted contrast matrices related to gender and disease status (normal or tumor) and calculated moderated t-statistics. Moreover we used the \textit{sva} R/Bioconductor package to remove the effect of the surrogate variables \citep{sva}. Representation of differentially expressed gene sets was performed with the R package \textit{Vennerable} \citep{Venn} and \textit{ggplot2} \citep{ggplot2}.

\subsection*{Functional enrichment}
The resulting sets of differentially expressed genes between different conditions according to gender or disease status (normal or tumor) was used to perform Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. For this purpose we used the R/Bioconductor package \textit{GOstats} with the Biological Process (BP) ontology and applied a conditional hypergeometric test in order to account for the hierarchical structure of GO terms \citep{Gostats}.The annotations were provided by the \textit{org.Hs.eg.db} package \citep{org}. 


\section*{Results and Discussion}

After the filtering and normalization of the data, we searched for batch effects. Apparently, after applying hierarchical clustering in the filtered data the samples cluster into tumor and normal separately (see Supplementary Materials). However, from the dendrogram we can see that there is a group of tumor samples closer to the normal ones as if there were two subgroups of tumor samples. Cross-tables between the elements encoded in the TCGA barcode and type of samples (tumor/normal) showed unbalanced data in all of them so it could be that one of them is the source of variability within tumor samples. From the dendrogram plots after clustering for each of the elements (samplevial, tss, portion and plate) and also after considering a multidimensional scaling plot it did not seem clear to us which was the reason for such inaccurate clustering of the tumor samples. We suspect that tss has something to do (see Supplementary Materials). We decided to apply the three strategies mentioned before (see Materials and Methods) to see whether we could improve the clustering. Although, \textit{QR} descomposition method and the SVD method are supposed to improved the clustering, the one that gave us a better dendrogram has been the results from applying \textit{ComBat} function (see Supplementary Materials). For this removal strategy, we have inlude tss as a covariate and we built the full model of our outcome of interest which included gender, type and barcode\_patient as fixed effects. As it has yield the best batch removal result, we decided to take it into account in the follow-up analysis.

A part from removing possible batch effect, we also have adjusted for the mean-variance relationship estimating weights at individual observation-by-gene level to fit the model.  

From the model, we wanted to figure out whether there is a gender effect in the expression level of certain genes in the context of thyroid tumor. So we were interested to see whether DE genes observed between tumor and normal were the same for within female samples (tumor  and normal) and within male samples (tumor and normal). For this reason, our contrasts of interest were made as 6 comparisons: Female vs. Male, Tumor vs. Normal, Female-Tumor vs. Female-Normal,  Male-Tumor vs. Male-Normal, Female-Normal vs. Male-Normal and Female-Tumor vs. Male-Tumor. Here we show the diagnostic plots for those comparisons that are more interesting (see Figure SCHEME)...

We can see from the QQplots that DE genes from all comparisons differ from adjusting to a t-Student distribution (see Supplementary material). The volcano plots (see Supplementary material) reveal an interesting extreme pattern in the comparisons between Tumor vs. Normal and Female-Tumor vs. Female-Normal where almost all DE expressed genes appear to be under-expressed. In contrast, the Male-Tumor vs. Male-Normal comparison present a less extreme volcano plot. Interestingly, in the comparison between Female vs. Male where the contrast is done by gender, without taking into account the sample type (tumor or normal), we see the opposite extreme pattern where females show over-expression of almost all genes. This is due to the main contribution of normal samples to this comparison. We can infer a higher gene expression in Female-Normal compared to Male-Normal samples whereas Female-Tumor and Male-Tumor samples do not have significant differences in gene expression (see Supplementary material). 

Venn diagrams in Figure ... help to explore the consistency of the obtained DE genes among the different comparisons. From the set of DE genes between disease and normal condition only 3 are found to be also differentially expressed in females (Female-Normal vs. Female-Disease) and 2 in males (Male-Normal vs. Male-Disease). So, even though the pattern from the volcano plots and the QQ plots of the 3 comparisons were similar actually a small amount of DE genes are shared to be differentially expressed among them. In contrast, taking both within gender comparisons (Female-Normal vs. Female-Disease and Male-Normal vs. Male-Disease) a larger proportion of genes are shared (54). Furhtermore, the direction of the fold change is also consistent in both comparisons, giving a set of 26 genes that are down regulated and 28 up regulated.





  




\section*{Additional guidelines}

\subsection*{Numbers} In the text, write out numbers nine or less except as part of a date, a fraction or decimal, a percentage, or a unit of measurement. Use Arabic numbers for those larger than nine, except as the first word of a sentence; however, try to avoid starting a sentence with such a number.

\subsection*{Units} Use abbreviations of the customary units of measurement only when they are preceded by a number: "3 min" but "several minutes". Write "percent" as one word, except when used with a number: "several percent" but "75\%." To indicate temperature in centigrade, use ° (for example, 37°); include a letter after the degree symbol only when some other scale is intended (for example, 45°K).

\subsection*{Nomenclature and Italicization} Italicize names of organisms even when  when the species is not indicated.  Italicize the first three letters of the names of restriction enzyme cleavage sites, as in HindIII. Write the names of strains in roman except when incorporating specific genotypic designations. Italicize genotype names and symbols, including all components of alleles, but not when the name of a gene is the same as the name of an enzyme. Do not use "+" to indicate wild type. Carefully distinguish between genotype (italicized) and phenotype (not italicized) in both the writing and the symbolism.
